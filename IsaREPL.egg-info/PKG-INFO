Isabelle REPL
====

Unofficial support for Isabelle's Read-Eval-Print-Loop.

**Features**
- Python Client, easy for Machine Learning.
- Full support for all Isabelle commands
- Tracing the proof state and the output panel for each step of evaluation.
	- Plugin: collecting data from Isabelle's internal representations by plugins written in Isabelle/ML ([example](./examples/example_plugin.py)).
- Socket based remote communication
- Socket based Concurrency
- State rollback ([example](./examples/example_rollback.py))

## Installation

We **only** support [Isabelle2023](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2023/index.html) and [Isabelle2024](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2024/index.html).

Ensuring `<ISABELLE-BASE-DIRECTORY>/bin` is in your `$PATH` environment
```
git clone https://github.com/xqyww123/Isa-REPL.git
cd Isa-REPL
git checkout $(isabelle version) # Error can raise if you are using an unsupported version of Isabelle
isabelle components -u .
pip install IsaREPL
```
## Start up the REPL server

```
# merely an example:
./repl_server.sh 127.0.0.1:6666 HOL ./tmp
```

Run `./repl_server.sh` to see the full explanation of the arguments and options.

## Example Clients

Every interface of our client is will documented (it is highly recommended to read our [source](./IsaREPL/IsaREPL.py)). Some examples are given in [the example folder](./examples).
```
# Run an example
./examples/example_eval.py 127.0.0.1:6666
```

To evaluate a whole theory file
```
./examples/eval_file.py 127.0.0.1:6666 $(isabelle getenv -b ISABELLE_HOME)/src/HOL/List.thy
```
## Notes

### Documents

All documents are given as docstrings attaching to Python client interfaces, see [the source](./IsaREPL/IsaREPL.py).
### Concurrency

This REPL supports concurrent evaluation of multiple files. However, to ensure proper error tracking and result tracing, it disables Isabelle's concurrency between commands within a single theory file. While Isabelle typically executes `by` commands asynchronously (continuing to the next command before completion), this REPL enforces synchronous evaluation. Each command must complete before the next begins, allowing for accurate capture and reporting of any failures.

Sledgehammer (via our `auto_sledgehamemr` wrapper, see [example](./examples/example_sledgehammer.py)) is still concurrent.
### Communication Protocol

It is possible to implement a client in other languages. However, the document for the communication protocol is not provided and I refer you to read our source code, as it should be simple enough.
## Contribution

Feel free to open any GitHub issue if you have any feature requests.

I am not a professional python developer, so contribution is highly welcome to enrich the client's features.
